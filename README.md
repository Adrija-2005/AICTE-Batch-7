# Fake News Detection System

This project is a Machine Learning based Fake News Detection System built using Logistic Regression and deployed with Streamlit.

## Problem Statement
Misinformation spreads rapidly through online platforms. This system helps users classify news articles as Real or Fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Logistic Regression

## Dataset
The model is trained on labeled news articles dataset containing:
- Fake News Articles
- Real News Articles

Dataset Source:
Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset

## How It Works
1. Text input is taken from user.
2. Text is transformed using TF-IDF Vectorizer.
3. Logistic Regression model predicts the class.
4. System displays prediction with confidence score.
